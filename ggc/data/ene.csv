1,"Open new areas for offshore oil drilling","Opening previously restricted areas, like the coast of Florida, could lead to the discovery of new oil fields.","Oil and gas extraction is a major cause of habitat destruction (such as coastal wetlands) and pollution. 

Increases risk of oil spills, which can kill species and damage habitats. 
",-2,"Creates jobs for oil and gas related industries. 

An oil spill could have devastating effects on the tourism and fishing industries.

Reduces dependence on foreign sources of oil and natural gas.",1,"Opening new fields increases production and revenues. 



Significant investment is required to locate oil deposits in new areas. ",0
2,"Allow deep water oil drilling ","Deep water drilling (10,000+ feet)  is risky and expensive. However, there is the potential of finding large deposits of oil and gas.
","Many of the deepest wells are near the continent's northernmost coral reefs, treasuries of marine life.

Deepwater drilling is risky and oil spills are more difficult to cap in deepwater.",-2,"Creates jobs for oil and gas related industries. 

An oil spill could have devastating effects on  the tourism and fishing industries.
",0,"Deepwater wells can produce more oil than shallow water wells. 

Risky investment as costs are higher and some wells don’t produce a profit. ",0
3,"Install solar plants","Solar power is an intermittent energy source, but new technologies have made it competitive with traditional sources.","Reduces pollution, as solar energy is a clean, carbon-free power source.  

Large solar farms could cause a loss of some wildlife habitat.",0,"Renewable energy will be more affordable if fossil fuel prices continue to rise. 

Reduces dependence on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. 

Higher rates may be passed on to consumers by utilities. ",1,"Diversifies the energy sources for the region. 

More expensive for utility companies to buy solar than fossil fuel-based electricity. 

High start-up cost is balanced by free fuel source and predictable operating costs over lifetime of plant. ",0
4,"Create smart grid
","Modern smart grids improve energy delivery when using alternative energy sources whose intermittent supply makes maintaining stable power more complex. They also allow small energy producers to sell power to the grid, and help reduce the recovery time from power outages.
","Smart grids make it easier to use alternative energy sources that don’t pollute the environment. 

Smart grids monitor peak usage and can make cities more energy-efficient.",2,"A modern, efficient grid is attractive to new businesses.

Small businesses can generate their own wind and solar energy and sell it back.",2,"Energy companies have greater control over delivery system, creating efficiencies. 

More energy sources become available as small producers sell energy to the grid.

5,"Create offshore floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) plants","FLNG (floating liquefied natural gas) plants are used to extract and liquefy natural gas from offshore natural gas fields. They can be moved to new fields when one is exhausted.
","Eliminates need for gas pipelines and other onshore infrastructure, which helps to preserve marine and coastal environments. 

Could impact fish and bird habitats with offshore lighting, noise, CO2 emissions, and possible leaks.",0,"Pumping gas to shore is expensive, FLNGs are cheaper to operate and create new economic opportunities. ",1,"Allows energy companies to tap natural gas reserves that would otherwise be “stranded”. 

Offshore facilities can be moved to new fields as needed. ",1
6,"Expand the production of cellulosic ethanol fuel ","Ethanol comes from a variety of sources like corn and switchgrass. Cellulosic ethanol, which comes from grasses, wood and other non-edible parts of plants, contains more energy than bio-ethanol, which is made from corn and other edible plants.","Cellulosic ethanol burns cleaner than gasoline and creates less greenhouse gas emissions. 

Switchgrass requires no fertilizer and is easier to grow than other ethanol sources like corn.

Overharvesting switchgrass could threaten coastal habitats.",1,"The ethanol industry creates new opportunities for farmers and refiners.

Creating energy from non-food crops would not reduce the amount of food for people to eat.",2,"Cellulosic ethanol has five times as much energy per unit than ethanol from corn. 
Ethanol can be added to gasoline to create a cleaner-burning fuel. 
The nation could produce enough ethanol to cover more than half of its gasoline needs",2
7,"Provide  energy conservation incentives","Incentives for energy conservation can range from rebates for weatherizing buildings to discounts on efficient appliances. These incentives are available for both homes and businesses. ","Energy conservation  lowers greenhouse gas emissions and leads to a healthier environment. ",1,"Conserving energy saves money for businesses.

Creates more opportunities for companies that manufacture energy-saving products. 
",2,"Energy conservation will help make the supply of fossil fuels last longer as the nation transitions to alternative sources.",1
8,"Invest in wind farms","The Gulf of Mexico's wide continental shelf offers large areas of shallow water where installing turbines is easier than deeper water. Turbines can also be placed on abandoned oil rigs.","Wind power is clean and renewable. 

Some threat to migrating birds. However,,the threat is less than other threats such as airplanes. Turbines can be shut down when birds approach. 
",1,"Wind energy is the lowest cost of all renewable options 

Building wind farms creates new economic opportunities for communities.",2,"Adds another energy source  to the region 

Depending on the amount of wind at a site, it may or may not be cost competitive with traditional energy sources. ",1
