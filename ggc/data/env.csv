1,"Estuary Protection","Estuaries are places where rivers meet the sea. Their mix of salt and fresh water creates a fertile habitat for fish, birds and marine life. They are also threatened by over-population, pollution and development.
","Preserves healthy habitat for important species. 

Establishes cleaner environment for people. 
",2,"Limits activities like dredging and channeling rivers for shipping.

Creates nursery habitat for fish and shrimp, which is good for the fishing industry.
",0,"Makes some areas off limits for oil/gas exploration and extraction. 
",-1
2,"Dead Zone outreach","The Dead Zone is an area of low  oxygen in the Gulf caused by nutrients from fertilizers brought by the Mississippi River. Fish and other marine life cannot survive in the Dead Zone. Educating farmers upstream could help change how they use fertilizer and minimize its impact.
","Creates a healthier habitat for marine species. 

Reduces the loss of marine species. ",2,"Reduces losses of fish, shrimp and oysters, which helps the fishing industry. 

Educating people about the Dead Zone can be  challenging and expensive. ",0,"Growing corn for ethanol contributes to the Dead Zone as farmers use more fertilizer.
",-1
3,"Regulate overfishing ","Overfishing is catching fish and shellfish faster than they can reproduce. This harms species and ecosystems as well as endangers the food supply.","Helps fish populations rebound and remain healthy year-to-year. ",1,"Upsets fishermen in the short term since fewer fish can be caught.

Benefits fishing industry in the long term; creates a more sustainable fish population.
",0,"Fishing boats use a significant amount of fuel; setting catch limits reduces fuel use. ",-1
4,"Detect    harmful algal blooms","A harmful algal bloom, or red tide, is caused by an increase in the marine algae K.brevis. This algae releases a toxin that can kill fish in large numbers, make shellfish poisonous to humans, and produce airborne irritants that drive people from beaches. Forecasting a red tide can help minimize its impact.","Helps reduce potential for eating contaminated fish and shellfish.


Reduces risk of harm to humans from contaminated beaches.
",2,"Reduces impact on tourism; gives people a chance to change their recreation plans. 

Benefits fishing industry; gives fishermen a chance to fish somewhere else.",2,"Impact on energy sector is neutral or minimal.",0
5,"Restore more coastal wetlands","Coastal wetlands include swamps, marshes and mangrove forests. They remove pollutants from water, protect against floods,  stabilize shorelines, and provide essential wildlife habitats and recreational areas.","Increases area that serves as an important habitat for wildlife.

Reduces pollution and maintain cleaner water for people and marine life.  


Filters river water and help reduce the size of the Dead Zone.
",3,"Provides  more recreational areas for hunting, fishing and birdwatching.

Expands essential nursery habitat for fish and shrimp; good for the fishing industry.

Provides important flood protection for coastal urban areas. 
",3,"Makes some areas “off limits” for oil/gas exploration and extraction.",-1
6,"Reduce aquatic pollutants ","The ecosystems of the Gulf are threatened by pollution from many sources. These include coastal industries, wastewater facilities, and storm run-off from cities and towns. Large cargo ships also add significant amounts of pollutants and debris.","Increases the variety and abundance of marine species.  

Reduces pollution and creates a healthier environment for people.
",2,"Benefits the fishing industry by improving fish habitats.

Benefits tourism and recreation industries by keeping beaches and other areas clean. 

Treating waste and industrial discharges to remove pollutants is costly. 
",1,"Some pollution reduction systems might require more energy.

Cleaning up oil tankers is costly.",0
7,"Create more marine  sanctuaries","Sanctuary waters provide a secure habitat for marine species, protect historically significant shipwrecks and artifacts, and preserve ecological diversity. ","Provides additional safe habitats for species.  

Serves as natural classrooms and laboratories for schools and researchers and promotes good stewardship of our oceans. ",2,"Provides recreational spots for sport fishing and diving, and supports industries such as tourism, fishing and kelp harvesting.

Restricts commercial fishing and shipping traffic. 
",0,"Prohibits oil drilling in the newly protected areas.

Restricts installation of wind platforms to generate energy.",-2
8,"Control invasive species","Ballast water discharges from transoceanic vessels are the single  largest source of aquatic non-indigenous species invasions. This threat is particularly serious in the Gulf because it is connected to the largest watershed in North America and has some of the world’s largest ports. 
","Reduces loss of native  species to invasive species.

Preserves natural balance of the environment.
",2,"Impacts commercial shipping through stricter regulations and enforcement. ",-1,"Impact on energy sector is neutral or minimal.",0
